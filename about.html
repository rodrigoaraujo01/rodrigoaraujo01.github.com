<p>Hello there.</p>
<p>My name is Rodrigo Araujo and I'm from Brazil.</p>
<p>Creating a blog has been a long time desire.</p>
<p>I've already tried twice (<a href="http://linil.wordpress.com">linil</a> and <a href="http://ofantasticomundogeek.wordpress.com">o fantastico mundo geek</a>). The first, was a group attempt at my old job and it was mildly successfull as it still gets constant 150+ page views everyday mostly originated on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stackoverflow</a>. The second one, written only in portuguese, has never hit the jackpot and its most popular page (a post about the mytical, at the time, <a href="http://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a>) shows only 264 views.</p>
<p>Sometime ago, I read in <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> about static blogs being developed in Ruby and being hosted on <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> using a library known as <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. As I don't know Ruby and though I do plan to learn it someday (far in the future), I already know <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>.</p>
<p>Searching the Internet, I found <a href="http://hyde.github.com">Hyde</a> which fulfills the same purpose as Jekyll, but is written in Python.</p>
<p>Before settling for Hyde, I tried other options like <a href="http://pelican.notmyidea.org">Pelican</a> or <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> but they were either too complex for my needs or had messy workflows.</p>
<p>So, here I am.</p>
<p>I've graduated as a Computer Engineer but, today, I work as a Petroleum Engineer. Therefore, maintaining a blog is a way to hone my coding skills as they're not much used on the day job.</p>
<p>The other reason is to provide a home to my pet <a href="./projects.html">projects</a> as they've been living in the wild for a while now.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact me.</p>  </section>
